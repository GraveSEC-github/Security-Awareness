### What is Security Awareness & Why does it Matter?

Understanding security awareness is crucial for protecting your organization from cyber threats. As someone embedded within the core of your company, you possess a pivotal role in its security posture although this should apply to everyone! By familiarizing yourself with common industry attacks and implementing mitigation strategies, you can bolster your cyber hygiene and intelligence.

Recent reports by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge/learning-center/common-threats-online-security?form=MA13I2/blob/main/README.md">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/what-is-email-security">Cloudflare</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/role-human-error-successful-cyber-security/">Quarks</a> on LinkedIn highlight that human errors, lack of attention to detail and knowledge are responsible for just about 90% of successful cyber attacks, including creditial theft, and social engineering such as phishing. This emphasizes the significant impact individuals have on organizational security.

### Average Cost of a Data Breach

In IBM's most recent report on the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach/blob/main/README.md">Cost of a Data Breach for 2023</a>, it was revealed that the average financial toll of a data breach reaches a staggering 4.45 million USD. Surprisingly, a significant portion of this sum (around USD 1.44 million) is attributed to detection and escalation expenses. Howeve! The implementation of threat intelligence can provide invaluable insights to security teams, enabling them to identify and respond to potential attacks earlier. By doing so, businesses can potentially decrease detection expenses and minimize or in some cases, prevent, the repercussions of successful breaches, safeguarding both finances and sensitive data.
