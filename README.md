# Security-Awareness
 "SECURITY AWARENESS IS SECURITY INTELLIGENCE." ~ Random qoute

## Objective

Hi! Things are just getting interesting, sseriously. My goal is to breifly elaborate the importance of having a professional understanding of security risks, vulnerabilities, policies, politics and soo much more. Primarlily, I'd like to tunnel our focus on the most commonly regconized frameworks today, NIST & SANS.

### What is Security Awareness & Why does it Matter?

Understanding security awareness is crucial for protecting your organization from cyber threats. As someone embedded within the core of your company, you possess a pivotal role in its security posture. By familiarizing yourself with common industry attacks and implementing mitigation strategies, you can bolster your cyber hygiene and intelligence.

This emphasizes the significant impact individuals have on organizational security. Enhancing your security awareness is essential for mitigating potential risks and threats to your organization, as evidenced by the study's findings.

### Average Cost of a Data Breach

In IBM's recent report on the href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach/blob/main/README.md">Cost of a Data Breach for 2023</a>, it was revealed that the average financial toll of a data breach reaches a staggering 4.45 million USD. Surprisingly, a significant portion of this sum (around USD 1.44 million) is attributed to detection and escalation expenses. Howeve! The implementation of threat intelligence can provide invaluable insights to security teams, enabling them to identify and respond to potential attacks earlier. By doing so, businesses can potentially decrease detection expenses and minimize or in some cases, prevent, the repercussions of successful breaches, safeguarding both finances and sensitive data.

### Skills Aquired

- NIST core functions Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
- Framework Implementation Tiers for Organizations (Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable, and Adaptive)
- SANS Critical Security Controls framework categories
- Help organizations mitigate the most common and damaging cyber threats with best practices.
